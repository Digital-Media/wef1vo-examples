# WEF1VO Web Fundamentals Examples

These are the code examples accompanying the lecture notes for WEF1VO Web Fundamentals. Topics revolve around basic web development techniques such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Lecturer: [Wolfgang Hochleitner](https://github.com/hochleitner)

Files in the ``main`` branch will change continuously throughout the summer semester. Once all lectures are completed, a tag will be created for the respective semester, and this state will be available for download as a [release](https://github.com/Digital-Media/wef1vo-examples/releases).

## Previous Names

This lecture has been renamed several times in the curriculum. The repository has been kept and renamed to its latest name. These were the class’s previous names:

1. WS 2016/17 to WS 2020/21: MTD114 Hypermedia 1
2. WS 2021/22 to WS 2024/25: HYP1VO Hypermedia 1 Part 1 Web Programming

## Usage

1. Optional: To host the files locally, get a development web server stack (e.g., the [fhooe-web-dock](https://github.com/Digital-Media/fhooe-web-dock) Docker containers). You can also open them directly from the file system.
2. Get a proper IDE (e.g., [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)).
3. Clone or download the repository as a ZIP file on your local disk. Choose your server's document root (e.g., fhooe-web-dock's `webapp` directory) if you use a web server.
4. Open the files in your web browser. The examples for each lecture are in the respective folder (e.g., `vo01` for lecture 1).

* Use your IDE to examine the contents of the files and see how they work.
* Pull the repository regularly to get the latest changes.
